Hi, I'm Mr. Hurst. I am the Head Coach of Choutime (FTC 12766). 

Choutime will post our code for previous games as well as some specific features we use. We will mostly use this as
a record for our team and training purposes. However, if you use something from our source code, please let us know
so we can help with any bugs or coding style differences. We are here to help in anyway we can, just reach out!

Thank you,
Mr. Hurst
